# the bluesky appview

This repo includes everything you need to run the Bluesky appview. It also serves a self-hosted PLC mirror and an instance of the web app.

**You'll need:**
- A domain
	- With the default settings, you'll want A records for `your.domain`, `bsky.your.domain`, and `plc.your.domain`, as well as, optionally, `api.your.domain` and `public.api.your.domain`.
- Docker, [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install)

## Setup
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
    - You can run `scripts/gen-secrets.sh` to generate the various passwords you'll need.
2. Run `scripts/build.sh` to build the Docker images.
3. Deploy with `docker compose up -d`.


After you've got the appview running, check out [backfill-bsky](https://github.com/zeppelin-social/backfill-bsky) if you'd like to fill in historical data.
